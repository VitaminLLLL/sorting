# Sorting algorithm implementation

## Selection sort

find the min(or max) item and then exchange the position with the first(last) item,
bubble sort is similar but exchange in every comparison.

## Insertion sort

Put the ith item in the correct position in the [0, i] sub array.

## Shell sort

## Merge sort

Recursive sorting, need additional O(n) space.
Sort the sub array then merge the result.

## Quick sort

The best practice sorting algorithm so far.
Select the pivot item then separate as 2 sub array
which All items are greater than pivot and the other is smaller.
Need to assure the array randomness.

## Heap sort

build a maximum Priority Queue, then keep delete the Max item.
